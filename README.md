# HomeServiceRobot

## Project Description

This project is the capstone to the Robotics Software Engineering nanodegree and puts together all or
the previous projects in the form of a simulated “home service” robot. This is a type of domestic robot
that could be tasked with simple tasks in a two dimensional three degree of freedom configuration
space. Such tasks could be cleaning (vacuuming or mopping) floors, mowing grass, or simple cargo
transport (like taking grocery bags from the front door to the kitchen). This project tasks the student
with putting together several pre-made packages from ROS with two custom packages written by the
student to conduct SLAM and navigation. The task it to have a robot drive to a pick up location, simulate
loading or picking up an object, and transporting it to a drop off zone.

## Package Descriptions

This project includes six total packages: `gmapping`, `turtlebot_teleop`, `turtlebot_rviz_launchers`, `turtlebot_gazebo`, `pick_objects`, and `add_markers`. The first four are pre-built packages and the final two are built by the student.
